# Other python algorithms

These are a few python algorithms made with python.
These include:
* A code to calculate the factorial of a number (`factorial.py`)
* A code to calculate the greatest common divisor(GCD) of a number (`gcd.py`)
* A code to convert images to a GIF animated image (`lcm.py`)
* A code to find out if the number is a palindrome number (`palindrome_number.py`)
* A code to compare the speed of two methods to find the square root of a number, binary search and linear search (`square_root.py`)
 
## Running Guide

This project is based on the Python programming language and primarily utilizes standard libraries like time.

### Environment Setup

Download the requirements.txt and install the required Python libraries. Please note all my 4 projects share the same requirements.txt. If you have done the installation for one project, you can skip it for the other 3 projects

```bash
# install all packages using requirements.txt
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Trying it out
You can try out the code and also mess with the parameters and test out different combinations.
I hope you will enjoy messing with the code!
